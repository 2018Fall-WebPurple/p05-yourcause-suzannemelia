        <h2> About ALSF and Alex </h2>
            <br /> 
            <p> Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) is changing the lives of children with cancer by funding impactful research, raising awareness, supporting families and empowering everyone to help cure childhood cancer. Alex was just 4 years old and battling neuroblastoma when she asked to give the money so doctors can find cures for all children battling cancer.Alex and her family continued to hold yearly lemonade stands in their front yard to benefit childhood cancer research. News spread of the remarkable sick child dedicated to helping other sick children. People from all over the world, moved by her story, held their own lemonade stands and donated the proceeds to Alex and her cause. </p>

        <h2> Our Heroes </h2>
            <br /> 
            <p> Ryan Eng, a 5 year old from Denver that is facing many struggles after being diagnosed with acute Lymphoblastic Lukemia says each daay, “Dear Jesus, thank you for this wonderful day.” Even in the scariest moments of Ryan’s fight–anxiously awaiting blood tests or taking steroids that alter his bubbly personality–the family remainss empowered by Ryan’s empathy.Eden, a 10 year old girl was diagnosed with a rare tumor, that doctors have never seen before. She is currently enrolled in an ALSF-funded clinical trial for children with relapsed solid tumors. Eden is just the 10th patient nationally to receive this treatment, but so far, the results have been positive. </p>
